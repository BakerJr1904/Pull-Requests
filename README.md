# Pull-Requests

In this repository I will create different pull requests.

### A pull request also referred to as a merge request

Is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.

### What are pull requests used for?

A pull requests is a way for a developer to notify his team that a feature or fix, developed on a separate branch, is ready. This lets everybody involved know that they can review the code, providing a forum discussing the implementation of the proposed feature.

### Why is it called a pull request?
It's called a pull request because you're asking the project to pull changes from your fork. They provide a simple, web-based way to submit your work (often called “patches”) to a project.</br>
Pull requests are a feature specific to GitHub.
### What is the difference between a commit and a pull request?
A commit is a discrete change to one or more files. It is a critical part of 'Git'. A pull request is a request to merge one or more commits into a different branch. It is not part of 'Git'; it is only part of 'GitHub.'<br/>
