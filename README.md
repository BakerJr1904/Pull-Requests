In this repository I will create different pull requests.

### What are pull requests used for?
A pull requests is a way for a developer to notify his team that a feature or fix, developed on a separate branch, is ready. This lets everybody involved know that they can review the code, providing a forum discussing the implementation of the proposed feature.
